# Roadmap

## FIX

- [ ] Fix authentication issue: The app loads, and directly checks for auth before it's available for some reason, hence the user is prompted to authenticate when they might already be logged in.

## FEATURES

- [Â ] Add a simple date parser to save progress. So users can input "minute 1" or "2 hours", and the mark can be kept.
- [ ] Add custom tags to track. So users can maybe add a #listen tag that will render a generic page with a dynamic url.
